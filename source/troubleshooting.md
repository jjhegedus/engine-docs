If you hit any issues in setting up Engine for your GraphQL service, we're here to help! First, follow these troubleshooting steps to check for any obvious issues. If these don't help, please submit a support ticket to [support@apollodata.com](mailto:support@apollodata.com) and we'll work with you to get you up and running!

<h2 id="sanity-checks" title="First steps">First Troubleshooting steps</h2>

<h3> Check that you are on a supported GraphQL server </h3>

Check that your server is one of the supported GraphQL servers listed [here](index.md#apollo-tracing).

If it is, please upgrade to the latest released versions of the GraphQL Server, Engine and Apollo packages.

You can enter the following into the commandline to check the package version, or look in  `package.json`.
```
$ npm view <apollo-engine or npm package> version
0.4.10
```

**Supported package versions**

graphql-js 0.10+
apollo-engine 0.4.11+
apollo-tracing 0.0.9+

<h3> Check for Engine configuration validity </h3>

These are sample configurations for Engine based on the server environment you are using. A comprehensive documentation on the configurations are available [here](proto-doc.md)  Use these as a guide to validate your configuration.

**Node sidecar**
```
{
  engineConfig: {
    apiKey: engineApiKey,
    logging: {
      level: 'DEBUG'   // Engine Proxy logging level. DEBUG, INFO, WARN or ERROR
    }
  },
  graphqlPort: process.env.PORT || 8003,  // GraphQL port
  endpoint: '/graphql',                   // GraphQL endpoint suffix - '/graphql' by default
  dumpTraffic: true                       // Debug configuration that logs traffic between Proxy and GraphQL server
}
```
**Ruby, Java, Elixir, Scala, or Node with Docker container**
```
{
  "apiKey": "<ENGINE_API_KEY>",
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO"
  },
  "origins": [
    {
      "http": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/graphql"
      }
    }
  ],
  "frontends": [
    {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 3001,
      "endpoint": "/graphql"
    }
  ]
}
```
**AWS Lambda**
```
{
  "apiKey": "<ENGINE_API_KEY>",
  "logcfg": {
    "level": "INFO"
  },
  "origins": [
    {
      "lambda": {
        "url":"arn:aws:lambda:xxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxxxx:function:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "awsAccessKeyId":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "awsSecretAccessKey":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "originType": "Lambda"
      }
    }
  ],
  "frontends": [
    {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 3001,
      "endpoint": "/graphql"
    }
  ]
}
```

<h3> Set debug logging levels for the Proxy</h3>

Set the Engine Proxy logging level to DEBUG or higher. These logs will be part of your GraphQL server logs (if Proxy is deployed as a sidecar) or in the Proxy process logs (if Proxy is deployed standalone).
```
const engine = new Engine({
  engineConfig: {
    apiKey: engineApiKey,
    logcfg: {
      level: 'DEBUG'   // Engine Proxy logging level. DEBUG, INFO, WARN or ERROR
    }
  },
  graphqlPort: process.env.PORT || 8003,  
  endpoint: '/graphql',                  
  dumpTraffic: true                       
});
```

<h3> Ensure you enabled Apollo Tracing </h3>

Test that you enaled Apollo Tracing by checking if your GraphQL server returns trace extensions in GraphQL responses. If it does, it's is a sign that Apollo Tracing is properly configured.

If using the sidecar deployment configuration - check that you integrated the Engine middleware into your server. Is it called Before all other middleware calls?

<h2 id="">Troubleshooting FAQs</h2>

**I'm getting an error saying “The query failed!”, how do I fix it?**

This may mean you need to upgrade an NPM package. Check that your package versions are all up-to-date. This also may mean a variety of other things. When this error is paired with a 503 error, the query did not receive an expected response.

Other common errors:

Query error: HTTP Status Code 400
```
Error parsing JSON query!\njson: cannot unmarshal array into Go value of type graphql.SerializedQuery\n[{\"query\":\"query 	
```
This is a known issue. As of version 0.4.11, Engine does not support batched queries. If you would like an update when the fix is released, please contact [support@apollodata.com](mailto:support@apollodata.com). 

**Why isn't data showing up in my dashboard? I followed your install guide exactly.**

We'd recommend double checking that your Engine API key is passing through to your server. 

Second, check the ordering of your middleware calls. One of the most common reasons is that the application middleware actually begins before the Engine proxy middleware, which needs to be called before. This is an easy step to miss!

Third, we currently support a certain range of language-specific GraphQL servers and middleware implementations in Node.js: Express, Hapi, Koa, Restify, and Lambda. If you are using a middleware like Restify, the proxy may not be supported. 

**What is shown on the Engine Proxy logs?**

Each time the Engine proxy starts, you should see the following 4 lines in the logs indicating the Engine proxy is healthy: 

``` 
time="2017-10-16T14:34:48-07:00" level=info msg="Creating frontend" endpoint=/graphql host=127.0.0.1 port=62590 
time="2017-10-16T14:34:48-07:00" level=info msg="Starting HTTP frontend" frontend="127.0.0.1:62590/graphql" 
time="2017-10-16T14:34:48-07:00" level=info msg="Added new origin" url="http://127.0.0.1:3010/graphql" (http://127.0.0.1:3010/graphql); 
time="2017-10-16T14:34:48-07:00" level=info msg="Set passthrough url" url="http://127.0.0.1:3010” (http://127.0.0.1:3010/); 
``` 

These lines are internal to the Engine proxy: the endpoint url that you want will be the same as you configured your application to run without Engine.
